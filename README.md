- 👋 Hi, I’m @MatrixMike
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin and Elixir. I am also trying to keep up my skills in other languages on these repo pages 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Linux utilities e.g. caja, also Arduino projects infact just about anything that has reference in a repo here... It could seem that I have many odd forks of software here : one reason is that the version of software provided automatically with a package seems to get stale and out of date soon -so I have sources which I build to be as up-to-date as possible.
- 📫 How to reach me ... TBA
